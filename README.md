## Main program

In the main program, two random polynomials having a power of 2 as the degree 
will be randomly generated and then the product will be calculated using 
the classical strategy as well as the divide and conquer one.

### Compilation

```bash
make
```

### Execution

```bash
./bin/polynomials n
```

Where n represents 2^n that will be the size of the polynomials.

## Test program

In the test program will be done both products showing the result values.

### Compilation

```bash
make test
```

### Execution

```bash
./bin/test_polynomials
```
